							<h2> What is a basis function expansion? </h2>
							<p> A basis function expansion (BFE) uses relatively simple equations to represent a more complex 
								distribution. Each term in the expansion is given a weight such that the sum of the functions 
								optimally represents the given distribution. In our case, we use BFEs to represent the 
								gravitational potential and mass distribution of the dark matter (and/or baryons) in a galaxy. 
								We tailor the expansion such that the zeroth order term represents the equilibrium state of the galaxy. 
								The BFE framework is a powerful tool for analyses of galactic dynamics and disequilibrium dynamics, in 
								particular. The EXP collaboration is built around the shared vision of developing these tools for galactic 
								dynamics, combining the varied expertise of its members to learn about disequilibrium dynamics in galaxies. 
								The publicly-available <a href="https://github.com/EXP-code">EXP code</a> was developed to help achieve 
								this task. As evidenced in the following pages, there are a number of use cases for BFE analysis framework, 
								and members of our collaboration have used BFEs to provide profound insight into a variety of problems. </p>

							<h2>Why should I use basis function expansions?</h2>
							<p> Basis function expansions (BFEs) provide a mathematical framework for interrogating and understanding 
								complex systems. Through this framework, it is possible to discover the underlying dynamics within 
								simulations that span the full gamut of complexity, ranging from idealized periodic boxes to large 
								cosmological simulations. This framework provides natural ties to analytic theory as well as new 
								supervised and unsupervised machine learning tools. One such tool is multi-channel Single Spectrum 
								Analysis (mSSA), and examples of using mSSA + BFE for dynamical discovery can be seen in 
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.501.5408W/abstract">here</a> and 
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.521.1757J/abstract">here</a> (see also the 
								<a href = "https://exp-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/ssa.html">EXP readme</a>). 
								A particularly powerful use of BFE is as a universal language to succinctly summarize the relevant 
								dynamical information in galaxies for comparison across and between different simulations.</p>

							<h2>Basis Function Expansions for Cosmological Simulations</h2>
							<p>Basis function expansions (BFEs) can be used as a post-processing analysis framework for cosmological simulations. 
								With BFEs, you can analyze the dark matter halo of your favorite galaxy from any cosmological 
								simulation to find wakes, dipoles, and more. You can also succinctly describe the stellar disk of
								a galaxy, use the expansions to integrate orbits in the gravitational potential, and more. See some highlights 
								of recent cosmological analyses below</p>

							<h2>Basis Function Expansions for N-body Dynamical Simulations</h2>
							<p>Basis function expansions (BFEs) can be used to both run and analyze dynamical N-body simulations. The EXP 
								collaboration - spearheaded by Martin Weinberg - has developed eponymous code to perform both of these 
								functions. EXP uses BFEs to represent the potential and mass distributions of the star and dark 
								matter particles of a galaxy to run simulations significantly faster than alternate techniques. The 
								theory underpinning BFE simulations and the implementation are discussed in 
								more detail in the <a href="https://exp-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/multistep.html"readthedocs></a>,
								as well as these papers (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999AJ....117..629W/abstract"1></a>, 
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.6201P/abstract"2></a>).</p>
							<p>The resulting simulations have both particle-based snapshot data and basis function information, including 
								the basis and time-evolving coefficients. These data can be used together to provide unique insight into 
								the underlying dynamics. EXP can also be run on simulations that were produced with different software, 
								including cosmological simulations, to provide BFEs at each time step. See below for
								examples that use either or both of these functionalities of EXP.</p>

							<h2>Basis Function Expansions for Observational Insight</h2>
							<p>Two dimensional basis function expansions can also be performed on observational data. Such 2D expansions 
								on image data describe the light (stellar) distribution in a galaxy, and provide a language for succinctly, 
								quantitatively summarizing the morphological features. We adopt a Fourier-Laguerre basis for image data, 
								which captures both the angular (Fourier) and radial (Laguerre) information. These expansions are also 
								how we map an image of a galaxy to a sound via sonification. We are currently developing a framework for 
								expansions of integral field spectrograph data, which will allow for analyses of both velocity and chemical 
								information. </p>

							<h2>Basis Function Expansions for Sonification</h2>
							<p>The light profile of a galaxy image can be described with a Fourier-Laguerre basis function expansion. 
								The resulting expansion has both angular (Fourier, m) terms and radial (Laguerre, n) terms and a series 
								of coefficient weights. While we typically plot these terms and weights for a visual representation, we 
								can also present these same data with sounds. In plotting these data, we might decide that the n-terms 
								are along the x-axis and the m-terms are along the y-axis, with the coefficient values making a heatmap. 
								Similarly, we could choose to map the n-terms to notes on a given scale, the m-terms to octaves, and the 
								coefficient amplitudes to volume. This mapping of data to sound is called sonification.</p>
							<p> We are pioneering the use of basis function expansions for sonfication. As part of this work, we have 
								created a GalaxyZoo project to determine the efficacy of classifying galaxy morphology through sounds, 
								or aural classification. Check out the project here (LINK COMING SOON) to test your own aural 
								classification skills! </p>
